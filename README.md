# Security Portfolio

Welcome to my Security Portfolio repository. This repository showcases the various audit reports I have written for smart contract auditing.
I make every effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code as possible within the given time period but hold no responsibility for the findings provided in these documents. My security audit is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. Most of the audits where time-boxed, focusing solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

## Introduction

Smart contracts are the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain platforms. Ensuring their security is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities that could lead to financial losses or exploitation. This repository contains all the audit reports I have conducted, highlighting my expertise in identifying and addressing security issues in smart contracts.
